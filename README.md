# Techie

Techie is a Telegram bot that helps individuals and teams prepare for hackathons by resolving their doubts and answering their questions related to the event. It aims to assist users in understanding the guidelines, rules, and requirements of the hackathon, as well as providing tips and resources for successfully completing the event. By providing quick and accurate information, Techie helps users to better understand and navigate the hackathon experience, allowing them to focus on creating and implementing their ideas.

The goal of Techie is to make the hackathon experience less intimidating and more accessible by providing users with the information and resources they need to succeed. It is a fun and interactive bot that encourages students to take part in hackathons and register there.

Here we tried to implement the telegram bot for the castor hackathon :)
